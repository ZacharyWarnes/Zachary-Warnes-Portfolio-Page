          <p>Howdy! I am a brand new programmer seeking employment and educational opportunities here in the 
              Pacific Northwest. My current focus is in Web Development using html, css, and javascript but I hope to continue to 
              advance my skill set and learn more programming languages as I progress through my career. I am a father of two, musician, gamer, enjoyer of fine spirits, 
              and all-around-good-time-haver. Please hire me immediately!</p>
